Enhance your NYU Dibner Library experience and preview the different study rooms available in Dibner Library through augmented reality. Reserve rooms quickly and easily.


### Additional Description

The app is created by students at New York University (NYU). The project was initially deployed on . The app is intended for both NYU and non-NYU students. For NYU students, they will be able to find quick links to reserve a specific room that they want without having to search them up online. Non-NYU students can look at certain rooms in the Dibner library in 3D augmented reality without needing student access to the library. Prospective students can then see the library of NYU without having to be a student first or simply if they are curious. NYU students can also enjoy the library in 3D for flair and showcasing purposes.
